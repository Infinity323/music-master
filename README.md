This project's organization is vaguely based on [React Flask Boilerplate](https://github.com/jeremyletran/react-flask-boilerplate): MIT Â© [Jeremy Le-Tran](https://github.com/jeremyletran).

## Building and Packaging


Package Backend (run this in server dir):
```
pyinstaller music_master_backend.spec
```
This will create an executable file of your Flask app in the dist directory.
Move the generated executable file to your Electron app's project root directory.

Package everything together:
```
npm run build
npm run electron-pack
```
